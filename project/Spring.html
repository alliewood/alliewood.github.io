    <h2>2017 New york Fashion</h2>
    <p>In New York, a huge fashion trend was matching colors. Waering the same clothing pieces that have the same color was a big statement piece. Usually we earn that you cannot wear a pink top with pink shorts but in 2017 this statement was proven wrong. Models everywhere were matching the colors of the their outfits with their acccessories. So if they were to have a blue outfit they would also wer blue shoes and a blue purse. </p>

    <p>Another spring trend was pastels. Spring tends to relate to warmer weather and flowers so to go with these ideas, people wore pastels. This created a much softer look then if they were to wear blod golors such as lime green and cobalt blue. With pastels, girls could still make a statement but it wasnt as in your face. </p>
